Team 5806's drive system for FRC Stronghold.

Made in eclipse using the wpilib FRC plugin.  
All code is nicely object-oriented into _**10**_ seperate classes, making the code easier to understand and use. 

Includes:
- Arm control
- Button handling
- Sensor handling
- Ultrasound handling
- Motor control
- Autonomous
- Regular control
- Vision processing
- Printing of information to SmartDashboard
 
The code is customisable by changing the constants marked in each class.  
The code is located in [Tank Drive/src/org/usfirst/frc/team5806/robot](Tank Drive/src/org/usfirst/frc/team5806/robot "Code Folder")

### Installation:
You must have the wpilib Eclipse Plugin installed. Then, import the project into eclipse, build, and deploy to your roboRIO using the wpilib plugin deploy function.  
Make sure you have your constants set correctly.
